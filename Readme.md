# Hello World CNN
Not just a **hello-world Repository** with entery-level code!<br>
In this repo I have worked to develop various models for the purpose of Image Classification and used them on various datasets.<br>
I have used **Keras** and **TensorFlow** as my backend framework.<br>

## Datasets
All the used datasets well-known around the deeplearning community. They include -
* [MNIST - Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data): A dataset of handwritten digits.
* [CIFAR-10](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cifar-10/data): A dataset of 32x32 color images of 10 classes of objects.

## Models
I have used various models to classify the images, they vary from simple **Sequential Models** to complex **Functional Models**, **Transfer Learning Models** and more.

Check the branches. I have created a new branch everytime I added a new dataset.
